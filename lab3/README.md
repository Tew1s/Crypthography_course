# Lab #3

Ð¡ustom program implementation of S-box and P-box algorithms (direct and inverse transformations).

### The requirements for the S-box are as follows:

- Input data size: 8 bits
- Output data size: 8 bits
- The input data block is divided into two nibbles of 4 bits each.

### The requirements for the P-box are as follows:

- Input data size: 8 bits
- Output data size: 8 bits
